- Time tracking continues even when browser is closed (tracks real-world time)
- Time accumulates across multiple sessions and persists through page refreshes
- Timer continues accurately even when adding, editing, or deleting other tasks
- Completed tasks show total time spent in a human-readable format (e.g., "2 hours 15 minutes 30 seconds")

### Google Calendar

2. Click "My Events" button in the header to connect your personal calendar
3. Authorize the application to access your calendar (OAuth 2.0)
4. View your upcoming events with title, date, time, and location

### Theme Switching
- Click the theme toggle button in the header to switch between dark and light modes
- Your preference is automatically saved and persists across sessions

## Technical Details

### Architecture
The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- **State Management**: Centralized notes state in `notes.js`
- **Rendering**: DOM manipulation isolated in `rendering.js`
- **Modals**: Dialog management in `modals.js`
- **Formatting**: Date/time utilities in `formatters.js`
- **Orchestration**: Main application logic in `main.js`
- **Time Tracking**: TimerManager class in `timer.js` with persistent state
- **Storage**: localStorage operations with migration in `storage.js`
- **Drag & Drop**: HTML5 drag-and-drop API in `dragDrop.js`
- **Theme**: Dark/light mode switching in `theme.js`
- **Event-Driven**: Custom events for cross-module communication

### Browser Compatibility
Works in all modern browsers that support:
- HTML5 Drag and Drop API
- ES6 Modules
- localStorage API
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- CSS Custom Properties (CSS Variables)

### Storage
All task data is stored locally in the browser's localStorage, including:
- Task details (text, description, priority, due date)
- Time tracking data (timeSpent, inProgressSince, timerStartTime)
- Task metadata (createdAt, lastEditedAt, startedAt, completedAt)

No data is sent to external servers except when using Google Calendar integration (which requires explicit user authorization). The application works completely offline once loaded.

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Code Style
- JavaScript: camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes
- CSS: camelCase for class names (e.g., `.appHeader`, `.taskCard`, `.priorityBadge`)
- CSS Variables: kebab-case with double dashes (e.g., `--priority-high`, `--bg-card`)
- Comments: File headers and concise single-line comments
- Consistent 2-space indentation throughout
- ES6+ features (arrow functions, template literals, destructuring)
